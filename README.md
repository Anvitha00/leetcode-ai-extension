# 🧠 LeetCode AI Sidekick — Chrome Extension

What if your LeetCode journey felt less like hitting a wall...  
...and more like **pair programming with an AI that actually gets you**?

Welcome to **LeetCode AI Sidekick** — a Chrome Extension powered by Ollama and local LLMs — here to turn your problem-solving into a guided, intuitive, and insightful experience.

## 🚀 What It Does

This extension seamlessly integrates with LeetCode to:
1. **👀 Read the problem statement automatically** from the page.
2. **🤖 Feed it to a local LLM** (via Ollama) to set the context.
3. **🧭 Ask you upfront:**
   - Want to describe your approach?
   - Or go straight into coding?

4. **🧠 If you describe the approach:**
   - The AI evaluates feasibility.
   - Estimates **time & space complexity**.
   - Suggests **optimizations** if any.

5. **💻 If you write code:**
   - Catches **syntax errors**.
   - Suggests **shortcuts** and cleaner alternatives.
   - Nudges you toward the correct solution — **no spoon-feeding**.

## ✨ Why It’s Different

> Think of this like your mindful mentor — not a cheating shortcut, but a guide that helps you think better.

- 🏃‍♀️ **Accelerates learning** without bypassing problem-solving.
- 🧘‍♂️ **Respects your thought process** — it waits, listens, and reflects with you.
- 💡 **Educates as it guides** — like a thoughtful TA, not a debugger robot.
